# Peixoto_SleepDevelopment
study changes in sleep dependent gene expression throught development 
Rational: changes in SWA after sleep deprivation only present around or after P24 (mice, wt), suggesting chagnes on the gene level to implement and consolidate response to sleep loss.
in this project are 
1) quantification using Salmon, including how to build a salmon index
2) analysis, A) RUV seq B) pathway analysis using DAVID (updated in 2022)
3)
